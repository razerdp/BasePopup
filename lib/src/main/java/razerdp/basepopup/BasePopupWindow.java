/**
 * <br>
 * <p>
 * 这是一个快速实现PopupWindow的基类，本基类易于扩展，并且几乎没有使用限制，便于您快速实现各种各样的PopupWindow。
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * BasePopup已经为您内部实现了多数实际使用遇到的复杂场景功能，比如背景模糊、展现动画、收起动画等。
 * 这些功能大多数都是可以由您自行定制或者决定是否执行，
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <a name="简单使用"></a>
 * <h2>简单使用说明：</h2>
 * 在继承了BasePopupWindow之后，会要求您实现三个方法（现仅强制实现{@link BasePopup#onCreateContentView()}）：
 * <br>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #onCreateShowAnimation()} 该方法决定您的PopupWindow将会以怎样的动画展示出来，可以返回为 {@code null}</li>
 * <li>{@link #onCreateDismissAnimation()} 该方法决定您的PopupWindow将会以怎样的动画小时，可以返回为 {@code null}</li>
 * <li>{@link BasePopup#onCreateContentView()} 该方法决定您的PopupWindow的contentView，<strong>一般不可以返回空值【{@code NotNull}】</strong>类似于{@link PopupWindow#setContentView(View)}，
 * 但建议使用基类方法{@link #createPopupById(int)}</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * 在您定义好基本的几个方法后，您可以创建PopupWindow实例并直接调用{@link #showPopupWindow()}方法即可
 * <li>
 * <strong>建议您在反复使用PopupWindow类中将PopupWindow定义为成员变量，方便复用</strong>
 * </li>
 * <pre>
 *     <strong>example：</strong>
 *           DemoPopup popup = new DemoPopup(context);
 *           popup.showPopupWindow();
 *     </pre>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <a name="关于背景模糊和背景颜色"></a>
 * <h2>关于背景模糊和背景颜色：</h2>
 * <br>
 * 从<strong>3.0</strong>版本开始，BasePopup进行了一次彻底重构，将背景层（包含模糊和背景颜色）和前景层（PopupWindow主体内容）完全分离，
 * 因此请不要再把背景颜色定义在您的PopupWindow的布局文件中，否则动画将会对整个前景造成影响导致不满意的效果。
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><strong>背景层（Mask层）：</strong>
 * <ul>
 * <li>背景颜色现在由api {@link #setBackgroundColor(int)}来制定，默认情况下，该颜色为{@code #8f000000}</li>
 * <li>通常情况下，Mask层是铺满整个屏幕的，如果您不需要Mask层铺满屏幕，您可以使用{@link #setAlignBackground(boolean)}把Mask层对齐到与您的PopupWindow主体一致</li>
 * </ul></li>
 * <li><strong>模糊层（Blur层）：</strong>
 * <ul>
 * <li>模糊默认关闭，如果您开启模糊，请设置{@link #setBlurBackgroundEnable(boolean)}为true，默认情况下模糊对象是当前decorView，如果您需要针对模糊某个View，
 * 请设置{@link #setBlurOption(PopupBlurOption)}以及{@link PopupBlurOption#setBlurView(View)}传入。</li>
 * <li>如果您想修改默认的背景模糊中的模糊配置，您可以调用{@link #setBlurBackgroundEnable(boolean, OnBlurOptionInitListener)}，在{@link OnBlurOptionInitListener#onCreateBlurOption(PopupBlurOption)}中进行修改</li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
