      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works

          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

/**
 * <br>
 * <p>
 * 这是一个快速实现PopupWindow的基类，本基类易于扩展，并且几乎没有使用限制，便于您快速实现各种各样的PopupWindow。
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * BasePopup已经为您内部实现了多数实际使用遇到的复杂场景功能，比如背景模糊、展现动画、收起动画等。
 * 这些功能大多数都是可以由您自行定制或者决定是否执行，
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <a name="简单使用"></a>
 * <h2>简单使用说明：</h2>
 * 在继承了BasePopupWindow之后，会要求您实现三个方法：
 * <br>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #onCreateShowAnimation()} 该方法决定您的PopupWindow将会以怎样的动画展示出来，可以返回为 {@code null}</li>
 * <li>{@link #onCreateDismissAnimation()} 该方法决定您的PopupWindow将会以怎样的动画小时，可以返回为 {@code null}</li>
 * <li>{@link BasePopup#onCreateContentView()} 该方法决定您的PopupWindow的contentView，<strong>一般不可以返回空值【{@code NotNull}】</strong>类似于{@link PopupWindow#setContentView(View)}，
 * 但建议使用基类方法{@link #createPopupById(int)}</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * 在您定义好基本的几个方法后，您可以创建PopupWindow实例并直接调用{@link #showPopupWindow()}方法即可
 * <li>
 * <strong>建议您在反复使用PopupWindow类中将PopupWindow定义为成员变量，方便复用</strong>
 * </li>
 * <pre>
 *     <strong>example：</strong>
 *           DemoPopup popup = new DemoPopup(context);
 *           popup.showPopupWindow();
 *     </pre>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <a name="关于背景模糊和背景颜色"></a>
 * <h2>关于背景模糊和背景颜色：</h2>
 * <br>
 * 从<strong>3.0</strong>版本开始，BasePopup进行了一次彻底重构，将背景层（包含模糊和背景颜色）和前景层（PopupWindow主体内容）完全分离，
 * 因此请不要再把背景颜色定义在您的PopupWindow的布局文件中，否则动画将会对整个前景造成影响导致不满意的效果。
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><strong>背景层（Mask层）：</strong>
 * <ul>
 * <li>背景颜色现在由api {@link #setBackgroundColor(int)}来制定，默认情况下，该颜色为{@code #8f000000}</li>
 * <li>通常情况下，Mask层是铺满整个屏幕的，如果您不需要Mask层铺满屏幕，您可以使用{@link #setAlignBackground(boolean)}把Mask层对齐到与您的PopupWindow主体一致</li>
 * </ul></li>
 * <li><strong>模糊层（Blur层）：</strong>
 * <ul>
 * <li>模糊默认关闭，如果您开启模糊，请设置{@link #setBlurBackgroundEnable(boolean)}为true，默认情况下模糊对象是当前decorView，如果您需要针对模糊某个View，
 * 请设置{@link #setBlurOption(PopupBlurOption)}以及{@link PopupBlurOption#setBlurView(View)}传入。</li>
 * <li>如果您想修改默认的背景模糊中的模糊配置，您可以调用{@link #setBlurBackgroundEnable(boolean, OnBlurOptionInitListener)}，在{@link OnBlurOptionInitListener#onCreateBlurOption(PopupBlurOption)}中进行修改</li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
